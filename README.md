# 1. Assignment1 (Creating Visualization)
## The Question
How significant is the bias of a face recognition algorithm, when it's trained on smiling women and neutral looking men and the test group only has neutral looking women and smiling men (*how often are the predictions wrong for men and women, showing which emotion*).
## The Creation
The Database for this project was created in the [Face Recognition Bias](https://wandb.ai/elsaesserniklas/4facesbias/reports/Face-Recognition-Bias-Report---Vmlldzo1NjUzNDg3?accessToken=ko7n0bkuhe2512rf4rz2zwfi6njqygqbi6a4ltw4d1sz97bxtj6ttw2hmla78iic) Project.

The Project had the goal to analyze the sex based bias when a face recognition algorithm is trained on Pictures of men and women, in which women smile all the time and men show neutral emotions.

For further information about the underlying data please check [Face Recognition Bias](https://wandb.ai/elsaesserniklas/4facesbias/reports/Face-Recognition-Bias-Report---Vmlldzo1NjUzNDg3?accessToken=ko7n0bkuhe2512rf4rz2zwfi6njqygqbi6a4ltw4d1sz97bxtj6ttw2hmla78iic).
## The Database
The resulting Database from the project looked like this:
